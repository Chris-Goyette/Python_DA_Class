# Data Analysis Journey using Python

## Introduction
Welcome to my journey through the basics of Python for Data Analysis! This project is not just another dataset exploration; it's a tale of my first steps into the data analysis world using Python.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to document my learning process in using Python to perform data analysis. Instead of focusing on profound insights from the data, this project emphasizes the 'how' over the 'what' of data analysis.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a dataset I found on Kaggle, which includes various basketball statistics from the 2021-22 season.You can find the [link to the data set here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data/data)

## Analysis Overview
In this notebook, I:
- Load and process the data, ensuring it's clean and organized for analysis.
- Create visualization plots (including a boxplot, histogram, kernel density plot, correlation heatmap, and a scatter plot) to begin understanding relationships within the data.
- Apply quantitative analysis techniques to interpret the plots and understand the basics of correlation in statistics.

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I've gained a foundational understanding of:
- Data manipulation and cleaning with pandas
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Basic statistical analysis and its application in Python

## Conclusion
In conclusion, while the notebook may not tell a traditional data story with a beginning, middle, and end, it captures the essence of a learner's path in data science.

## Reproducibility
This project is fully reproducible; you should be able run the Jupyter Notebook from start to finish without errors.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Google Colab to open the `.ipynb` file.
3. Run each cell sequentially to follow my learning progression.

## Comments and Contributions
Feedback is immensely appreciated as it aids my learning. Please feel free to leave comments or suggest improvements!

### Discussion Points:
- **My Story:** This project narrates my initiation into Python data analysis, showcasing the initial steps rather than deep insights.
- **Conclusion Discovery:** The conclusion reached is not data-driven but rather knowledge-driven; it encapsulates the learning process and the acquisition of basic skills.
- **Significance:** The most significant part of this analysis for me was learning how to clean and manipulate data with pandas and visualizing this data to draw basic correlations and trends.
